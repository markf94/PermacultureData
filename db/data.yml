    - Blue Honeybell Bush
    - Another frost hardy shrub that always delivers. It is drought hardy, evergreen,
      fast growing and does well in the full sun or semi shade. It also flowers all
      year and attracts butterflies. It is perfect for pots and would be a good choice
      for a townhouse garden. It responds well to pruning and makes a neat formal
      hedge which naturally grows to about 1.5 meters. Yon can happily cut it much
      shorter if youâ€™d like a short hedge to edge your garden bed or demarcate an
      area.

    - Tree Tumbo
    - Welwitschia is a monotypic gymnosperm genus, comprising solely the distinctive
      Welwitschia mirabilis. The plant is commonly known simply as welwitschia in
      English, but the name tree tumbo is also used. It is called kharos or khurub
      in Nama, tweeblaarkanniedood in Afrikaans, nyanka in Damara, and onyanga in
      Herero. Welwitschia is the only living genus of the family Welwitschiaceae and
      order Welwitschiales, in the division Gnetophyta. Informal sources commonly
      refer to the plant as a "living fossil".[2][3] Welwitschia mirabilis is endemic
      to the Namib desert within Namibia and Angola.

    - Wild Licorice
    - The plant is best known for its seeds, which are used as beads and in percussion
      instruments, and which are toxic because of the presence of abrin. Ingestion
      of a single seed, well chewed, can be fatal to both adults and children.[5]
      The plant is native to India and grows in tropical and subtropical areas of
      the world where it has been introduced. It has a tendency to become weedy and
      invasive where it has been introduced.

    - Wild Dagga
    - Another drought hardy, evergreen shrub that is very dependable. It is common
      and widespread throughout South Africa and grows amongst rocks in our grasslands.
      It is fast growing and there are yellow, orange or white flowering forms. The
      flowers are good for the vase but you do want to leave many on the bushes as
      they attract the sunbirds and the insect eaters. They are also good for a butterfly
      garden as they are the larval host for the Bush Bronze butterfly. They flower
      in autumn and will need cutting back at the end of winter. A must for a bird
      garden as once you get to recognize the sunbirds chirping, you will be very
      pleased that you are making them happy. It has been admired since 1652 and was
      growing in the Chelsea Physic Garden in London in 1712. It is called Wild Dagga
      as the Khoi smoked the dried leaves and it was said to be narcotic. It is considered
      to be a miracle plant as it is used medicinally to reduce blood pressure, for
      arthritis, sores that will not heal, athletes foot and nits. The leaves are
      used for headaches, coughs, colds, convulsions, weak joints, cataracts, hemorrhoids,
      a diuretic and for obesity. The roots are used for snake bite and to keep snakes
      away. The flowers are used for asthma, haemorrhoids, headaches, chest problems,
      bronchitis, tapeworm, TB, jaundice, skin diseases, muscular cramps, bee and
      scorpion stings. A wealth of uses. It is now planted in Australia.

    - Wild date palm
    - "The plants are unisexual and florets appear at the top of the palm stem. Male
      florets are a dirty, pale yellow and fall off after blooming; females are small,
      globose and yellow-green.[2] This species grows edible, oblong fruit, orange
      in color (when ripe), at 2.5 cm in diameter. The fruit are borne in large, pendant
      clusters and contain one seed each.[2]\r\n\r\nPalms across the Phoenix genus
      readily hybridize with one another resulting in naturally occurring variations.
      They usually tolerate salt-spray, and moderate drought where the water table
      is permanently high."
